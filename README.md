# Introduction to Generative Art

Generative art can be an intimidating topic -- it seems like there is a lot of math involved, and art is tricky in itself! But, it doesn't have to be difficult -- you can build some really cool things without a math or art degree. This post will break down what generative art even is and how you can get started building your own generative art.

## First, what is code art?

Code art is any art that is built using code. There are endless examples on CodePen -- for example [CSS art](https://dev.to/aspittel/learning-css-through-creating-art-54c0).

## What is generative art?

Generative art is art built with code, but, on top of that, it incorporates randomness in some way. Therefore, each time you run your script, load your page, or upon some user interaction we get a different piece of art. 

In a way, the art work becomes a collaboration between the computer and the artist. Some aspects of the artwork are controlled by the coder, but not all of them. The artist controls the randomness in the art.

Usually generative art draws inspiration from modern art.

## What goes into a piece of generative art?

* **Randomness** is crucial for creating generative art. The art should be different each time you run the generation script, so randomness is usually a large part of that.

* **Algorithms** -- Implementing an algorithm visually can often generate awesome art, for example the binary tree above.

* **Geometry** -- Most generative art incorporates shapes, and the math from high school geometry class can aid in some really cool effects.

## How can you approach a generative art piece?

There are two main strategies for creating generative art, though most will fall between the two strategies. The first is to have no results in mind and see what the computer generates as you play around. The second is that you have a very finalized idea of what you want the art to look like, and the randomness only slightly changes the end result.

## Where should you start?

If you know JavaScript, [P5.js]() is an awesome place to start. Its goal is to "make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners." It is a wrapper on the [Canvas API](), and it simplifies a lot of the math. It focuses on drawing, but you can also do sound, video, or webcam interaction with it if you are interested in those forms of art!

## A Quick Introduction to P5

First, load in the [P5 CDN](). Then, in your JavaScript file, you will add two functions that will be used in pretty much ever P5 script: `setup` and `draw`. These names are necessary for P5 to call them. 

`setup` is called when the program start. You will probably create a canvas to draw on within it using the `createCanvas` function, and you may set some defaults there. It is only called once!

`draw` is called after setup, and is executed constantly until you call `noLoop`, which will stop it from running again. You can control how many times `draw` runs each second with the `frameRate` function. With generative art, I usually put `noLoop` in the `setup` function, which makes `draw` only run once instead of continuously.

[Here's a P5 starter template](https://codepen.io/aspittel/pen/EeJJBm)

## P5 Lines

You can create a line in P5.js like this:

```js
line(startX, startY, endX, endY)
```

Then, you can randomly generate a bunch of lines and create a simple piece of generative art like this:

Even really simple scripts can generate cool pieces of art!

## P5 Movement

## Color

## Another Strategy: Tweaking Tutorials

You can also generate really cool generative art by taking someone else's work and building off of it. For example, here's the result of a tutorial by [Dan Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw):

Here are two tweaks of it to create different effects:

You can follow tutorials, fork CodePens, or Glitch projects and create something new and unique! Just make sure to give the original artist some credit too.
